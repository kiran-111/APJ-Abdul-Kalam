<img img src="scientist.jpg" alt="Abdul Kalam" class="center"><br>
<p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, 
Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation 
(by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). 
He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. 
Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. 
In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first 
Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; 
Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. 
In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.<br><br>
Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation 
from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political 
and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, 
along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist. 
However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.
Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.<br><br>
In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent". 
In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".<br><br>
